## Build info

You'll need [LCD5110 library](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=47) to run this sketch.

Arduino is used for image output only. All sound and synchronization work is done on PC side by playing audio of [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkgK8eUdpAo&fmt=22).
Download it as mp4 file using one of YouTube downloaders or find somewhere else.

To compile server you'll need C# compiler (included in any version of Microsoft Visual Studio). 
Add reference to "Windows Media Player" COM object and change "images" and "tohou.mp4" paths to the actual paths on your computer.
